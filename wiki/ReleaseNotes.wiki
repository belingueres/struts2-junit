= struts2-junit 0.2 =

  * Modified {{{@Config}}} annotation to support multiple Struts 2 XML configuration files.

Example use case: Say you are developing an [http://struts.apache.org/2.2.3.1/docs/plugins.html Struts2 plugin], which commonly includes a {{{struts-plugin.xml}}} which is used to configure or initialize the plugin.

If your test depends on this plugin, then you can configure the test my annotating with:

{{{@Config(file={"struts-plugin.xml", "struts-test.xml"})}}}

This will load the following configurations, in this specific order:

  # struts-default.xml (allways loaded first by default)
  # struts-plugin.xml
  # struts-test.xml

= struts2-junit 0.1 =

  * First public release.
